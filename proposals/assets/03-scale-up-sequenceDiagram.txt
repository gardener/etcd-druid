activate etcd resource
note over etcd resource: .spec.replicas: 1 -> 3
etcd resource -> etcd-druid controller: Cluster  has been marked for scale-up
activate etcd-druid controller
activate etcd statefulSet
activate etcd member lease object


etcd-druid controller ->etcd configuration template: updates config-map
activate etcd configuration template
etcd-druid controller -> etcd member lease object : checks member lease object's annotation
note over etcd member lease object: \n kind: Lease\n metadata: \n   annotations: \n      member.etcd.gardener.cloud/tls-enabled: "false"\n spec: . . .
etcd-druid controller -> etcd-druid controller : calculates whether TLS \nis enabled for peerUrl or not
note over etcd-druid controller: If peerUrl is not TLS enabled,\netcd-druid will make sure to enable TLS for \npeerUrl before marking the cluster for scale-up.

activate etcd container
etcd-backup-restore sidecar container ->etcd container: memberUpdate API call\nto update peerUrl
etcd-backup-restore sidecar container ->etcd container: checks etcd's health status
etcd-backup-restore sidecar container ->etcd member lease object: update member lease annotation

etcd-druid controller ->etcd-druid controller: peerUrl is now TLS enabled \nmake sure first cluster member \nis running fine. 
etcd-druid controller ->etcd statefulSet: mark the cluster for scale-up \nupdates .spec.replicas `1`-> `3` \nadds scale-up annotation 
note over etcd statefulSet: apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: StatefulSet\nmetadata:\n    annotation: \n      gardener.cloud/scaled-to-multi-node: "\" \n spec:\n   replicas: 3\n  ....
etcd statefulSet ->etcd statefulSet: statefulSet controller \n brings 2 new etcd pods
