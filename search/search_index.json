The interface has three methods which is expected to be implemented:</li> <li><code>Admit(ctx context.Context) Result</code>: Validates preconditions for the task.</li> <li><code>Execute(ctx context.Context) Result</code>: Contains the core logic to perform the task.</li> <li><code>Cleanup(ctx context.Context) Result</code>: Cleans up any resources created during task execution.</li> <li>Each of these methods should return a <code>Result</code> struct which has the fields:</li> <li><code>Requeue</code> (bool): Indicates if the task should be requeued.</li> <li><code>Error</code> (error): Any error encountered during processing.</li> <li><code>Description</code> (string): A human-readable description of the current state or error. <p>NOTE:  1) The <code>Admit</code> method is run when the task is created to validate preconditions. If it fails, the task is marked as <code>Rejected</code>. If it succeeds, the task moves to <code>InProgress</code> state and this method is not called again. 2) The <code>Execute</code> method is called repeatedly in case of timeouts/transient errors until the task execution is successful or a non-retryable error occurs. Once this is done the task moves to <code>Succeeded</code> or <code>Failed</code> state respectively. 3) The <code>Cleanup</code> method is called when the task reaches a terminal state (Succeeded/Failed/Rejected) to clean up any resources created during the task execution. This can be a no-op if there are no resources to clean up. (Refer the on-demand-snapshot handler implementation for reference). 4) Refer the etcdopstask api for details regarding the etcdopstask state transitions and status fields.</p> </li> <li>Transient error handling is to be done via setting the <code>requeue</code> field in the return type from the corresponsing methods with appropriate <code>Error</code> and <code>Description</code> field clearly indicating the reason.

This may not be as rare as majority members' disk/volume failure. The risk can be somewhat mitigated at least for planned maintenance operations by postponing potentially disruptive maintenance operations when <code>BackupReady</code> condition is <code>false</code> (vertical scaling, rolling updates, evictions due to node roll-outs).</p> <p>But in practice (when ephemeral storage is used), the current proposal suggests restoring from the latest full backup even when a minority of ETCD members (even a single pod) restart both to speed up the process of the new member catching up to the latest revision but also to avoid load on the leading member which needs to supply the data to bring the new member up-to-date. But as described here, in case of a minority member failure while using ephemeral storage, it is possible to restart the new member with empty data and let it fetch all the data from the leading member (only if backup is not accessible). Though this is suboptimal, it is workable given the constraints and conditions. With this, the risk of additional data loss in the case of ephemeral storage is only if backup failure as well as quorum loss happens. While this is still less rare than the risk of additional data loss in case of persistent storage, the risk might be tolerable. Provided the risk of quorum loss is not too high.
