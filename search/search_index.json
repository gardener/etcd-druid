While it helps to vertically scale up etcd-member pods, it also can cause transient quorum loss. This is a direct consequence of the design of VPA - where recommendation is done by Recommender component, Updater evicts the pods that do not have the resources recommended by the <code>Recommender</code> and Admission Controller which updates the resources on the Pods. All these three components act asynchronously and can fail independently, so while VPA respects PDB's it can easily enter into a state where updater evicts a pod while respecting PDB but the admission controller fails to apply the recommendation. The pod comes with a default resources which still differ from the recommended values, thus causing a repeat eviction. There are other race conditions that can also occur and one needs to be careful of using VPA for quorum based workloads.</p>"},{"location":"deployment/production-setup-recommendations.html#high-availability","title":"High Availability","text":"<p>To ensure that an <code>Etcd</code> cluster is highly available, following is recommended:</p>"},{"location":"deployment/production-setup-recommendations.html#ensure-that-the-etcd-cluster-members-are-spread","title":"Ensure that the <code>Etcd</code> cluster members are spread","text":"<p><code>Etcd</code> cluster members should always be spread across nodes.

The risk might still be acceptable but the idea is to gain experience about how frequently member containers/pods get restarted/recreated, how frequently leader election happens among members of an etcd cluster and how frequently etcd clusters lose quorum.

This has the effect of setting the etcd main container (and hence the etcd pod) as not ready if the latest backup upload failed. This results in the endpoints controller removing the pod IP address from the endpoints list for the service which eventually cuts off ingress traffic coming into the etcd pod via the etcd client service. The rationale for this is to fail early when the backup upload fails rather than continuing to serve requests while the gap between the last backup and the current data increases which might lead to unacceptably large amount of data loss if disaster strikes. </p> <p>This approach will not work in the multi-node scenario because we need the individual member pods to be able to talk to each other to maintain the cluster quorum when backup upload fails but need to cut off only client ingress traffic. </p> <p>It is recommended to separate the backup health condition tracking taking appropriate remedial actions.

As described here, re-bootstrapping the ETCD cluster requires restoration from the latest backup only when a majority of members no longer have uncorrupted data persistence.</p> <p>If persistent storage is used, this will happen only when backup failure as well as a majority of the disks/volumes backing the ETCD cluster members fail simultaneously. This would indeed be rare and might be an acceptable risk.</p> <p>If ephemeral storage is used (especially, in-memory), the data loss will happen if a majority of the ETCD cluster members become <code>NotReady</code> (requiring a pod restart) at the same time as the backup failure. This may not be as rare as majority members' disk/volume failure. The risk can be somewhat mitigated at least for planned maintenance operations by postponing potentially disruptive maintenance operations when <code>BackupReady</code> condition is <code>false</code> (vertical scaling, rolling updates, evictions due to node roll-outs).</p> <p>But in practice (when ephemeral storage is used), the current proposal suggests restoring from the latest full backup even when a minority of ETCD members (even a single pod) restart both to speed up the process of the new member catching up to the latest revision but also to avoid load on the leading member which needs to supply the data to bring the new member up-to-date. But as described here, in case of a minority member failure while using ephemeral storage, it is possible to restart the new member with empty data and let it fetch all the data from the leading member (only if backup is not accessible). Though this is suboptimal, it is workable given the constraints and conditions. With this, the risk of additional data loss in the case of ephemeral storage is only if backup failure as well as quorum loss happens. While this is still less rare than the risk of additional data loss in case of persistent storage, the risk might be tolerable. Provided the risk of quorum loss is not too high. This needs to be monitored/evaluated before opting for ephemeral storage.</p> <p>Given these constraints, it is better to dynamically avoid/postpone some potentially disruptive operations when <code>BackupReady</code> condition is <code>false</code>. This has the effect of allowing <code>n/2</code> members to be evicted when the backups are healthy and completely disabling evictions when backups are not healthy. 1.
