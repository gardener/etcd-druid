#### TaskState

_Underlying type:_ _string_

	   ↘                 ↘ Failed | Rejected
	    └────────────────→ Rejected

_Validation:_
- Enum: [Pending InProgress Succeeded Failed Rejected]

_Appears in:_
- [EtcdOpsTaskStatus](#etcdopstaskstatus)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Pending` | TaskStatePending indicates that the task has been accepted but not yet acted upon.<br /> |
| `InProgress` | TaskStateInProgress indicates that the task is currently being executed.<br /> |
| `Succeeded` | TaskStateSucceeded indicates that the task has completed successfully.<br /> |
| `Failed` | TaskStateFailed indicates that the task has failed.<br /> |
| `Rejected` | TaskStateRejected indicates that the task was rejected because it was invalid or could not be processed.<br /> |


#### WaitForFinalSnapshotSpec



WaitForFinalSnapshotSpec defines the parameters for waiting for a final full snapshot before copying backups.



_Appears in:_
- [EtcdCopyBackupsTaskSpec](#etcdcopybackupstaskspec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` _boolean_ | Enabled specifies whether to wait for a final full snapshot before copying backups. |  |  |
| `timeout` _[Duration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.29/#duration-v1-meta)_ | Timeout is the timeout for waiting for a final full snapshot. When this timeout expires, the copying of backups<br />will be performed anyway. No timeout or 0 means wait forever. |  | Pattern: `^(0\|([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?(ns\|us\|µs\|ms\|s\|m\|h))+)$` <br />Type: string <br /> |
