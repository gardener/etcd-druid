# Setup Etcd-Druid Locally

This document will guide you on how to setup `etcd-druid` on your local machine and how to provision and manage `Etcd` cluster(s).

## 00-Prerequisites

Before we can setup `etcd-druid` and use it to provision `Etcd` clusters, we need to prepare the development environment. Follow the [Prepare Dev Environment Guide](../../development/prepare-dev-environment.md) for detailed instructions.

## 01-Setting up KIND cluster

`etcd-druid` uses [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) as it's local Kubernetes engine. The local setup is configured for kind due to its convenience only. Any other Kubernetes setup would also work. 

```bash
make kind-up
```

This command sets up a new Kind cluster and stores the kubeconfig at `./hack/kind/kubeconfig`.  Additionally, this command also deploys a local container registry as a docker container. This ensures faster image push/pull times. The local registry can be accessed as `localhost:5001` for pushing and pulling images. 

To target this newly created cluster, set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the kubeconfig file.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/hack/kind/kubeconfig
```

> **Note:**  If you wish to configure kind cluster differently then you can directly invoke the script and check its help to know about all configuration options.

```bash
./hack/kind-up.sh -h
  usage: kind-up.sh [Options]
  Options:
    --cluster-name  <cluster-name>   Name of the kind cluster to create. Default value is 'etcd-druid-e2e'
    --skip-registry                  Skip creating a local docker registry. Default value is false.
    --feature-gates <feature-gates>  Comma separated list of feature gates to enable on the cluster.
```

## 02-Setting up etcd-druid

### Configuring etcd-druid

Prior to deploying `etcd-druid`, it can be configured via CLI-args and environment variables. 

* To configure CLI args you can modify [`charts/druid/values.yaml`](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/blob/master/charts/druid/values.yaml).  For e.g. if you wish to `auto-reconcile` any change done to `Etcd` CR then you should set `enableEtcdSpecAutoReconcile` to true. By default this will be switched off.
* `DRUID_E2E_TEST=true` : sets specific configuration for etcd-druid for optimal e2e test runs, like a lower sync period for the etcd controller.

### Deploying etcd-druid

Any variant of `make deploy-*` command uses [helm](https://helm.sh/) and [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) to build and deploy `etcd-druid` to the target Kubernetes cluster. In addition to deploying `etcd-druid` it will also install the [Etcd CRD](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/blob/master/config/crd/bases/crd-druid.gardener.cloud_etcds.yaml) and [EtcdCopyBackupTask CRD](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/blob/master/config/crd/bases/crd-druid.gardener.cloud_etcdcopybackupstasks.yaml).

#### Regular mode

```bash
make deploy
```

The above command will use [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) to build and deploy `etcd-druid`  to the k8s kind cluster pointed to by `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

#### Dev mode

```bash
make deploy-dev
```

This is similar to `make deploy` but additionally starts a [skaffold dev loop](https://skaffold.dev/docs/workflows/dev/). After the initial deployment, skaffold starts watching source files. Once it has detected changes, you can press any key to update the `etcd-druid` deployment.

#### Debug mode

```bash
make deploy-debug
```

This is similar to `make deploy-dev` but additionally configures containers in pods for debugging as required for each container's runtime technology. The associated debugging ports are exposed and labelled so that they can be port-forwarded to the local machine. Skaffold disables automatic image rebuilding and syncing when using the `debug` mode as compared to `dev` mode.

Go debugging uses [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve). Please see the [skaffold debugging documentation](https://skaffold.dev/docs/workflows/debug/) how to setup your IDE accordingly. 

!!! note
    Resuming or stopping only a single goroutine (Go Issue [25578](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25578), [31132](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31132)) is currently not supported, so the action will cause all the goroutines to get activated or paused.

This means that when a goroutine is paused on a breakpoint, then all the other goroutines are also paused. This should be kept in mind when using `skaffold debug`.

## 03-Configure Backup [*Optional*]

### Deploying a Local Backup Store Emulator

!!! info
    This section is ***Optional*** and is only meant to describe steps to deploy a local object store which can be used for testing and development. If you either do not wish to enable backups or you wish to use remote (infra-provider-specific) object store then this section can be skipped.

An `Etcd` cluster provisioned via etcd-druid provides a capability to take regular delta and full snapshots which are stored in an object store. You can enable this functionality by ensuring that you fill in [spec.backup.store](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/blob/master/config/samples/druid_v1alpha1_etcd.yaml#L49-L54) section of the `Etcd` CR. 

| Backup Store Variant          | Setup Guide                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Azure Object Storage Emulator | [Manage Azurite](manage-azurite-emulator.md) (Steps 00-03) |
| S3 Object Store Emulator      | [Manage LocalStack](manage-s3-emulator.md) (Steps 00-03)   |

### Setting up Cloud Provider Object Store Secret

!!! info
    This section is ***Optional***. If you have disabled backup functionality or if you are using local storage or one of the supported object store emulators then you can skip this section.

A Kubernetes [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) needs to be created for cloud provider Object Store access. You can refer to the Secret YAML templates [here](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore/tree/master/example/storage-provider-secrets).  Replace the dummy values with the actual configuration and ensure that you have added the `metadata.name` and `metadata.namespace` to the secret.

!!! tip
    * Secret should be deployed in the same namespace as the `Etcd` resource.
    * All the values in the data field of the secret YAML should in `base64` encoded format.

To apply the secret run:
```bash
kubectl apply -f <path/to/secret>
```

## 04-Preparing Etcd CR

Choose an appropriate variant of `Etcd` CR from [samples directory](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/tree/master/config/samples).

If you wish to enable functionality to backup delta & full snapshots then uncomment `spec.backup.store` section.

```yaml
# Configuration for storage provider
store:
  secretRef:
    name: etcd-backup-secret-name
  container: object-storage-container-name
  provider: aws # options: aws,azure,gcp,openstack,alicloud,dell,openshift,local
  prefix: etcd-test
```

Brief explanation of the keys:

* `secretRef.name` is the name of the secret that was applied as mentioned above.
* `store.container` is the object storage bucket name.
* `store.provider` is the bucket provider. Pick from the options mentioned in comment.
* `store.prefix` is the folder name that you want to use for your snapshots inside the bucket.

!!! tip
    For developer convenience we have provided object store emulator specific etcd CR variants which can be used as if as well.

## 05-Applying Etcd CR

Create the Etcd CR (Custom Resource) by applying the Etcd yaml to the cluster
```bash
kubectl apply -f <path-to-etcd-cr-yaml>
```

## 06-Verify the Etcd Cluster

To obtain information on the etcd cluster you can invoke the following command:
```bash
kubectl get etcd -o=wide
```

We adhere to a naming convention for all resources that are provisioned for an `Etcd` cluster. Refer to [etcd-cluster-components](../../concepts/etcd-cluster-components.md) document to get details of all resources that are provisioned.

### Verify Etcd Pods' Functionality

`etcd-wrapper` uses a [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) image, which lacks a shell. To interact with etcd, use an [Ephemeral container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/) as a debug container. Refer to this [documentation](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-wrapper/blob/master/docs/deployment/ops.md#operations--debugging) for building and using an ephemeral container which gets attached to the `etcd-wrapper` pod. 

```bash
# Put a key-value pair into the etcd 
etcdctl put <key1> <value1>
# Retrieve all key-value pairs from the etcd db
etcdctl get --prefix ""
```

For a multi-node etcd cluster, insert the key-value pair using the `etcd` container of one etcd member and retrieve it from the `etcd` container of another member to verify consensus among the multiple etcd members.

## 07-Updating Etcd CR

`Etcd` CR can be updated with new changes. To ensure that `etcd-druid` reconciles the changes you can refer to options that etcd-druid provides [here](../../usage/managing-etcd-clusters.md#update-&-reconcile-an-etcd-cluster).

## 08-Cleaning up the setup

If you wish to only delete the `Etcd` cluster then you can use the following command:
```bash
kubectl delete etcd <etcd-name>
```

This will add the `deletionTimestamp` to the `Etcd` resource.  At the time the creation of the `Etcd` cluster, etcd-druid will add a finalizer to ensure that it cleans up all `Etcd` cluster resources before the CR is removed. 
```yaml
  finalizers:
  - druid.gardener.cloud/etcd-druid
```

etcd-druid will automatically pick up the deletion event and attempt clean up `Etcd` cluster resources. It will only remove the finaliser once all resources have been cleaned up.

If you only wish to remove `etcd-druid` but retain the kind cluster then you can use the following make target:
```bash
make undeploy
```

If you wish to delete the kind cluster then you can use the following make target:
```bash
make kind-down
```

This cleans up the entire setup as the kind cluster gets deleted.
