# Manage S3 Emulator

This document is a step-by-step guide on how to configure, deploy and cleanup [LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/), within a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster. LocalStack emulates AWS services locally, which allows the `Etcd` cluster to interact with AWS S3. This setup is ideal for local development and testing.

## 00-Prerequisites

Ensure that you have setup the development environment as per the [documentation](../prepare-dev-environment.md).

> **Note:** It is assumed that you have already created kind cluster and the `KUBECONFIG` is pointing to this Kubernetes cluster.

### Installing AWS CLI

To interact with `LocalStack` you must also install the AWS CLI `(version >=1.29.0 or version >=2.13.0)`
On macOS run:

```bash
> brew install awscli
```

For other OS, please check the [AWS CLI installation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

## 01-Deploy LocalStack

```bash
> make deploy-localstack
```

The above make target will deploy `LocalStack` in the target Kubernetes cluster.

## 02-Setup S3 Bucket

Configure `AWS CLI` to interact with LocalStack by setting the necessary environment variables. This configuration redirects S3 commands to the LocalStack endpoint and provides the required credentials for authentication.

```bash
> export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3="http://localhost:4566"
> export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ACCESSKEYAWSUSER
> export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=sEcreTKey
> export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2
```

Create a S3 bucket using the following command:
```bash
> aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <bucket-name> --region <region> --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=<region> --acl private
```

To verify if the bucket has been created, you can use the following command:
```bash
> aws s3api head-bucket --bucket <bucket-name>
```

## 03-Configure Secret

Connection details for an Azure S3 Object Store are put into a Kubernetes [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). Apply the Kubernetes Secret manifest through:

```bash
> kubectl -f apply config/samples/etcd-secret-localstack.yaml
```

> **Note:** The secret created should be referred to in the `Etcd` CR in `spec.backup.store.secretRef`.

## 04-Cleanup

In addition to the kind cluster cleanup you should also unset the environment variable set in step-03 above.
```bash
> unset AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
```
