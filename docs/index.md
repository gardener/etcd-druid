`etcd-druid` is an [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) [operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) which makes it easy to configure, provision, reconcile, monitor and delete etcd clusters. It enables management of etcd clusters through [declarative Kubernetes API model](config/crd/bases/crd-druid.gardener.cloud_etcds.yaml). 

In every etcd cluster managed by `etcd-druid`, each etcd member is a two container `Pod` which consists of:

- [etcd-wrapper](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-wrapper) which manages the lifecycle (validation & initialization) of an etcd.
- [etcd-backup-restore](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore) sidecar which currently provides the following capabilities (the list is not comprehensive):
    - [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) DB validation.
    - Scheduled [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) DB defragmentation.
    - Backup - [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) DB snapshots are taken regularly and backed in an object store if one is configured.
    - Restoration - In case of a DB corruption for a single-member cluster it helps in restoring from latest set of snapshots (full & delta).
    - Member control operations.

`etcd-druid` additional provides the following capabilities:

- Facilitates declarative scale-out of [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) clusters.
- Provides protection against accidental deletion/mutation of resources provisioned as part of an etcd cluster.
- Offers an asynchronous and threshold based capability to process backed up snapshots to:
  - Potentially minimize the recovery time by leveraging restoration from backups followed by [etcd's compaction and defragmentation](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/op-guide/maintenance/). 
  - Indirectly assert integrity of the backed up snaphots.
- Allows seamless copy of backups between any two object store buckets.

## Start using or developing `etcd-druid` locally

If you are looking to try out druid then you can use a [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster based setup.
