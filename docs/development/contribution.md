# Contributors Guide

`etcd-druid` is an actively maintained project which has organically evolved to be a mature and stable etcd operator. We welcome active participation from the community and to this end this guide serves as a good starting point.

## Code of Conduct

All maintainers and contributors must abide by [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). Real progress can only happen in a collaborative environment which fosters mutual respect, openeness and disruptive innovation.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) before they submit the first pull request to the IronCore project, this happens in an automated fashion during the submission process. We use [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).

## License

Your contributions to `etcd-druid` must be licensed properly:

* Code contributions must be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
* Documentation contributions must be licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

## Contributing

`etcd-druid` use Github to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute).
* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create an issue first followed by a pull request.
* If you plan to do something more involved, first discuss your ideas by creating an [issue](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/issues). This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal of inspiration.

## Steps to Contribute

* If you wish to contribute and have not done that in the past, then first try and filter the list of issues with label `exp/beginner`. Once you find the issue that interests you, add a comment stating that you would like to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from contributors on the same issue.
* If you have questions about one of the issues please comment on them and one of the maintainers will clarify it.

We kindly ask you to follow the [Pull Request Checklist](raising-a-pr.md) to ensure reviews can happen accordingly.

## Issues and Planning

We use GitHub [issues](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/issues) to track bugs and enhancement requests. Please provide as much context as possible when you open an issue. The information you provide must be comprehensive enough to understand, reproduce the behavior and find related reports of that issue for the assignee. Therefore, contributors may use but aren't restricted to the issue template provided by the etcd-druid maintainers.
