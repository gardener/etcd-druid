# .dockerignore ignores all files unrelevant for build (e.g. docs) to only copy relevant source files to the build
# container. Hence, git will always detect a dirty work tree when building in a container (many deleted files).
# This command filters out all deleted files that are ignored by .dockerignore to only detect changes to relevant files
# as a dirty work tree.
# Additionally, it filters out changes to the `VERSION` file, as this is currently the only way to inject the
# version-to-build in our pipelines (see https://github.com/gardener/cc-utils/issues/431).
